A simple and flexible package manager

# What is ransack?
Ransack, named after the Transformers Cybertron character, is a source-based package management system that is suitable for anyone, especially those who're building their own distribution, or just want a package management system whose packages could be hosted anywhere easily. It's so easy that one would only need a simple online directory, or even a GitHub repository.
